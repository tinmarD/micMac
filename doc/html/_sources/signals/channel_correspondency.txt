******************************
    Channel Correspondency
******************************

When working with several related signals, the channel correpondency between the two signals has to be set. This can be done when loading the signal (SEE LINK) or by accessing signal information (SEE LINK). 

The following interface appears :

.. figure:: /_images/signals_channel_correspondency_popup_2.png
   :align: center

To link channels between the two signals, select the corresponding channels on the two lists and clink the **Link** button. To remove a link, select the channels and push the **Unlink** button. The **Reset** button will remove all links.

.. note:: 

   micMac will automatically try to detect the correspondency between channels based on the name of the channels.
