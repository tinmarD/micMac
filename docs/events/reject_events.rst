       Reject or Select events
************************************

It is possible to reject or select the signal part defined by global events. It can be used for removing artefact periods and exporting some parts of the signal. Use the *Events/Reject events* :

Global events must first be defined. 

Select the type of event you want to reject or select. If you need to include the events parts, check the *Include* checkbox. Select the signal from which the data will be extracted.

For creating a new signal, composed only of the event parts (if selection of the events) or without the event parts (if rejection of the events), check the *Create new signal* checkbox. 

.. note::
   This is similar to the *Signal/Export/Export from Events* menu. This last tool is useful for exporting signal from events.
