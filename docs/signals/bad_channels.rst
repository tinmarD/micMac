    Bad Channels
*********************

To mark some channels as *bad*, first select the bad channels on the channel selection panel, then go to **Signal>Mark as bad channels**. 

This will add an "*" to the bad channels' name in the channel selection panel. Once marked as bad, the channels will not appear on any view. To unmark the channels, do the same operation.
