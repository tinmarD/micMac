HFOs detectors
---------------

micMac include High Frequency Oscillation detectors. The detector implementation comes from `RIPPLELAB <https://github.com/BSP-Uniandes/RIPPLELAB>`_. 

For the article see `RIPPLELAB: A Comprehensive Application for the Detection, Analysis and Classification of High Frequency Oscillations in Electroencephalographic Signals <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158276>`_

RIPPLELAB includes four different detectors : 

 - Short Time Energy detector, as described by Staba
 - Short Line Length detector
 - Hilbert Transform based detector
 - The MNI detector

Interictal Epileptic Discharges detectors
------------------------------------------

micMac also includes 2 detectors for IEDs (Intericat Epileptic Discharges). However these detectors have not been tested and should not be used, or with great care in regards with their performances.
